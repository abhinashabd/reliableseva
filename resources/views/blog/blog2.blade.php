                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                        Gas leakage is one of the most common and costly AC problems faced by homeowners. Unlike regular servicing, advance deep cleaning focuses specifically on areas where gas leakage usually develops over time. These areas include copper joints, bends, connectors, and internal fittings that are exposed to moisture, dust, and corrosion. Advance deep cleaning targets these vulnerable points to restore strength and durability.

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#0A2540] mb-4">Why Gas Leakage Happens in Air Conditioners</h2>
                    
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                        Gas leakage generally occurs due to rust formation, weak joints, improper installation, vibration during operation, or long-term wear and tear. Over time, moisture buildup inside the indoor unit causes corrosion at joint points. This corrosion weakens the metal surface and slowly leads to gas leakage, affecting cooling performance.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#0A2540] mb-4">How Advance Deep Cleaning Is Different from Regular Service</h2>
                    
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                        Regular AC service mainly focuses on cleaning filters, coils, and basic inspection. Advance deep cleaning goes much deeper by addressing internal joint health. It involves dismantling critical parts, detailed joint cleaning, rust removal, and protective treatment. This specialized approach is designed specifically to prevent gas leakage rather than just improving cooling temporarily.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#0A2540] mb-4">Importance of Workshop-Based Servicing</h2>
                    
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                        To deliver consistent and reliable results, the indoor unit is taken to the workshop instead of being serviced on-site. Workshop servicing allows controlled cleaning conditions, better tools, proper chemical treatment, and thorough drying. This level of precision is not possible during standard home servicing.

                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                        All copper joints and connectors inside the indoor unit are carefully cleaned to remove dust, oil residue, and corrosion. Rust-free joints ensure proper sealing and reduce microscopic gaps that can cause gas to escape over time. This step forms the foundation of effective gas leakage prevention.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#0A2540] mb-4">Role of Rust Removal in Gas Leakage Prevention</h2>
                    
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                        Rust is one of the biggest enemies of AC gas retention. Even small rust patches can weaken joints and create leakage points. During advance deep cleaning, rust is completely removed from affected areas to restore the metal's original strength and stability.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#0A2540] mb-4">What Is Double Coating Protection</h2>
                    
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                        Double coating protection is a specialized protective layer applied over cleaned joints and vulnerable areas. This coating acts as a shield against moisture, oxidation, and corrosion. The double-layer application ensures stronger protection compared to single-coating methods.
                    </p>
                    
                    <div class="bg-blue-50 p-6 rounded-2xl my-8 border-l-4 border-[#0A2540]">
                        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-[#0A2540] mb-2">How Double Coating Strengthens Joint Sealing</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-700">
                            Once applied, the coating seals micro-gaps and reinforces joint connections. It prevents external moisture from coming in contact with metal surfaces and reduces the chances of future corrosion. Stronger joint sealing directly translates into reduced gas leakage risk.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#0A2540] mb-4">Long-Term Benefits of Double Coating Treatment</h2>
                    
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                        Double coating not only prevents immediate leakage but also slows down long-term degradation of joints. This helps maintain stable gas pressure inside the system, ensuring consistent cooling performance for months after servicing.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#0A2540] mb-4">Why This Service Comes with a Gas Leakage Warranty</h2>
                    
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                        The 6-month gas leakage warranty reflects confidence in the servicing process. Since joints are cleaned, treated, and protected under controlled conditions, the risk of leakage is significantly minimized. The warranty provides customers with peace of mind and assurance of service quality.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#0A2540] mb-4">Consistent Cooling Performance After Treatment</h2>
                    
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                        When gas pressure remains stable, the AC delivers uniform and efficient cooling. Advance deep cleaning with double coating helps maintain optimal gas levels, preventing sudden cooling loss or uneven temperature distribution.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#0A2540] mb-4">Reduced Need for Frequent Gas Refilling</h2>
                    
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                        One of the major advantages of this service is the reduced need for repeated gas refilling. Gas refilling without fixing the root cause only provides temporary relief. This treatment addresses the core issue, saving time and money in the long run.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#0A2540] mb-4">Protection Against Moisture and Humidity Damage</h2>
