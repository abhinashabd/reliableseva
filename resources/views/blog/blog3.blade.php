                        Top Reasons for AC Gas Leakage and When You Need Professional Repair
                    </h1>
                    
                    <p class="text-xl text-gray-700 font-medium mb-8">
                        AC gas leakage is a common issue that reduces cooling efficiency and increases electricity bills. The main reasons include worn-out pipes, loose connections, corrosion in coils, or accidental damage. If your AC is not cooling properly, making unusual noises, or showing ice formation on the pipes, it's time to call a professional. Regular check-ups and timely repair prevent bigger problems, keep your AC running efficiently, and extend its lifespan.

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#0A2540] mb-4">Understanding Why AC Gas Leakage Is a Serious Issue</h2>
                    
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                        AC gas plays a crucial role in absorbing heat from indoor air and releasing it outside. When gas leaks, the cooling cycle becomes inefficient. Even a small leakage can significantly reduce cooling performance and force the AC to work harder, leading to higher power consumption and faster component wear.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#0A2540] mb-4">Worn-Out Pipes Due to Aging</h2>
                    
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                        Over time, AC copper pipes naturally weaken due to continuous pressure, temperature changes, and long-term usage. Older pipes may develop tiny cracks that are not visible initially but slowly lead to gas leakage. This is especially common in ACs that are more than a few years old and have not received proper maintenance.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#0A2540] mb-4">Loose Connections and Poor Fittings</h2>
                    
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                        Loose flare nuts, weak joints, or improper installation are common causes of gas leakage. Vibrations during AC operation can slowly loosen fittings, creating small gaps where gas escapes. Professional inspection helps identify and tighten these weak connection points before they cause major cooling loss.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#0A2540] mb-4">Corrosion in Coils and Joints</h2>
                    
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                        Moisture, dust, and pollutants can lead to corrosion in evaporator coils and copper joints. Corrosion weakens metal surfaces and creates pinhole leaks. This type of leakage develops gradually and often goes unnoticed until cooling performance drops significantly.
                    </p>
